# Pantry
Pantry is a mobile application that helps users minimize food waste by suggesting recipes based on the ingredients available in their fridge. With cutting-edge neural network technology, Pantry automates the ingredient-tracking process, allowing users to make the most out of the ingredients they have.

# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR DOWNLOAD:
1) Download the zip from github
2) Unzip
3) Select New -> Import in Android Studio and select the unzipped Pantry folder. 
3) Use an Emulator to run the app** (NATIVE EMULATOR FOR PANTRY: Pixel 6 Pro) 

**Package errors can be fixed by "Cold Booting" the Emulator and then running the app in Android Studio (this is not an error with Pantry, but with the Emulator).

# How it Works
Pantry uses an optimized ingredient-detection model based on deep learning networks generated using Python in Google Colab and Google’s TensorFlow. Users simply take a picture of their fridge and Pantry identifies the ingredients present in the image. The app then suggests recipes that use those ingredients, minimizing food waste and saving users time and money.

# Features
- Ingredient detection based on neural network technology
- Recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
- A user-friendly UI developed using Kotlin in Android Studio

# Technologies Used
Pantry leverages powerful and reliable Google technologies to bring its vision for a more sustainable future to life. The application uses Google Colab and Google’s TensorFlow for deep learning and Kotlin for Android app development.
